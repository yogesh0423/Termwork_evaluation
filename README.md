# Termwork_evaluation
The Student Term Work Evaluation System is a Python Tkinter desktop app that helps teachers calculate studentsâ€™ term work marks automatically. It reads data from a CSV file, applies a fixed formula to compute final scores, displays results in an easy-to-use interface, and allows exporting results to a new CSV file.
